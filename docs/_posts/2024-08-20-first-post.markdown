Welcome!

This is my first post for my blog and showcase site on github.
I intend to blog around once a week, covering Data Engineering or related topics and showcasing projects that I am working on.

For my first post I will point to a small Python Pandas project where I attempted to answer a question about Bitcoin mining rates.

[Bitcoin Interval Check]

I recently updated this project to use Poetry to manage the python dependencies, making this a portable project.
