On Sept. 26th, 2024, I gave a presentation at the Tech Lancaster Meetup, about Makefiles and how they can save you time over shell scripts.

[Presentation] - remarkjs slides

[Demo Makefile] - demonstration makefile that I used during the talk.  *Bonus* - lockfile Makefile as discussed in the Q&A section in the video - thanks to "Presto" for the idea.
